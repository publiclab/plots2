        <p>At Public Lab, we all collaborate to invent and improve open source environmental science tools. <b>Wiki pages</b> are web pages that anyone can create or edit -- we use them to collect information, documentation, and instructions on projects.</p>
        <p><b>Wiki pages can be:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>a <a href="/tag/tutorial">tutorial</a> on how to make something</li>
          <li>documentation of a project</li>
          <li>an event planning page</li>
          <li>a place to collect lists of research notes</li>
          <li>etc!</li>
