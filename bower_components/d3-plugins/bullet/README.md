# Bullet Chart

[Demo](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4061961) and [vertical version](http://bl.ocks.org/jasondavies/5452290).

Designed by Stephen Few, a bullet chart “provides a rich display of data in a
small space.” A variation on a bar chart, bullet charts compare a given
quantitative measure (such as profit or revenue) against qualitative ranges
(e.g., poor, satisfactory, good) and related markers (e.g., the same measure a
year ago). Layout inspired by
[Stephen Few](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/misc/Bullet_Graph_Design_Spec.pdf).
Implementation based on work by
[Clint Ivy](http://projects.instantcognition.com/protovis/bulletchart/),
Jamie Love of [N-Squared Software](http://www.nsquaredsoftware.com/) and
[Jason Davies](http://www.jasondavies.com/).
