# Markdown?

Here's a teensie bit of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown\)/ "Original introduction )to Markdown") to get you started.

Markdown lets you <mark>produce **rich** HTML-formatted text by writing _plain text_</mark>. You can write `code`, text in _italics_ or give them **a "bolder" format**. You can create headings by prefixing them with one or more hash characters _(#)_. The _less hashes_ they have, the _more prominent_ your headings become.

Creating **links** is merely a matter of [wrapping some text in brackets][2] and referencing a resource locator, like the ones you'll find at the bottom of this text. <mark>Images can be embedded</mark> just the same, except you'll have to prefix the wrapped text with _an exclamation mark_.

> Click on the <kbd>HTML</kbd> button to see this text come to life as HTML, the <mark>markup</mark> language of the web.

Note that,

```javascript
var markTags = 'still work';
var within = true;

function code (<mark>here, are, some, args</mark>) {
  // do wonderful things!
  return here * are - some + args;
}
```
