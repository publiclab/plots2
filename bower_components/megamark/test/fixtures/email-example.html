<p>Hey there, I just wanted to let you know there’s a special offer on my book today, <em>it’s <strong>half off</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Get half off my <strong>JavaScript Application Design</strong> book today! Enter code <strong>dotd072115au</strong> at <a href="/author/compose">bevacqua.io/bf/book</a> when checking out. If you run into any issues, let me know.</p>
<p>Alright, back to writing about modules! <em>psst, don’t tell anyone!</em></p>
<p>Oh, now you can reply to any emails sent from this account. That means this very email but also the ones when I publish an article or a someone submits a comment. I’ll be reading the replies. So any feedback you want to send, that’s another way to do that.</p>
<p>Thanks,
Nico</p>
