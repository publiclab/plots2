Hey there, I just wanted to let you know there's a special offer on my book today, _it's **half off**_.

Get half off my **JavaScript Application Design** book today! Enter code **dotd072115au** at [bevacqua.io/bf/book][1] when checking out. If you run into any issues, let me know.

Alright, back to writing about modules! *psst, don't tell anyone!*

Oh, now you can reply to any emails sent from this account. That means this very email but also the ones when I publish an article or a someone submits a comment. I'll be reading the replies. So any feedback you want to send, that's another way to do that.

Thanks,
Nico
