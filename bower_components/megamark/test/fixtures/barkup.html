<h1 id="markdown">Markdown?</h1>
<p>Here’s a teensie bit of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" title="Original introduction to Markdown">Markdown</a> to get you started.</p>
<p>Markdown lets you produce <strong>rich</strong> HTML-formatted text by writing <em>plain text</em>. You can write <code class="md-code md-code-inline">code</code>, text in <em>italics</em> or give them <strong>a “bolder” format</strong>. You can create headings by prefixing them with one or more hash characters <em>(#)</em>. The less hashes they have, the more prominent your headings become.</p>
<p>Creating links is merely a matter of <a href="http://stompflow.com">wrapping some text in brackets</a> and referencing a resource locator, like the ones you’ll find at the bottom of this text. Images can be embedded just the same, except you’ll have to prefix the wrapped text with an exclamation point.</p>
