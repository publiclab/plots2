      # tables. That being said, the whole save process for ActiveRecord is wrapped in a transaction. Trying to authenticate
      # with OpenID in a transaction is not good because that transaction be get rolled back, thus reversing all of the OpenID
      # inserts and making OpenID authentication fail every time. So We need to step outside of the transaction and do our OpenID
      # madness.
      #
      # Another advantage of taking this approach is that we can set fields from their OpenID profile before we save the record,
      # if their OpenID provider supports it.
