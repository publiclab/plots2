# Community Check-ins

One of our community values is openness and diversity in thought. For this reason, we have started weekly check-ins run by our contributors (you!). The check-ins are currently opened as issues in the [plots2](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=) repository for convenience, but are meant to instigate discussions about any and all repos / topics related to Public Lab. Find the current week's check-in pinned at the top for easy reference.

New contributors are encouraged to get engaged :).

Below we provide you with information for getting involved and making your own post. These are just guidelines - we encourage you to get creative and lead the check-in with whatever words you would like 💫.

## Rundown 

- First things first:
our community aspires to be a respectful place. Please read and abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://publiclab.org/conduct).

- Check-ins are typically opened as issues anytime on Sunday or Monday.

- Volunteer to open the next check-in by leaving a comment on the current one.

-  When you open an issue please use our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/publiclab/publiclab) chatroom to
notify everyone by referencing `@/all` and linking the post. Include a brief message for new contributors so that they know what it is. ex:

_"Hey! Please see our weekly check-in here. Everyone is welcome to contribute and we encourage new users to get involved"_


- Check-ins have a _theme_. Select any theme that interests you to guide the general flow of responces from the communtiy. 

- Add anything else you'd like. Discovered a new technology you'd like to share? Found an interesting article about open source? Have any questions? 

- Include sections from the last post that make sense to carry over - if you need additional guidance reference past check-ins.

## Thanks!
