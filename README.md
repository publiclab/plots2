The content management system for the Public Lab research community, the plots2 web application is a combination of a group research blog of what we call "research notes" and a wiki. 

It features a Bootstrap-based UI and a variety of community and attribution features that help the Public Lab community collaborate on environmental technology design and documentation, as well as community organizing. Originally a Drupal site, it was rewritten in 2012 in Ruby on Rails, and has since extended but not entirely replaced the legacy Drupal data model and database design. 

Some key features include:

* a Markdown-based research note and wiki editor
* [wiki editing](https://publiclab.org/wiki) and revision tracking
* tagging and tag-based content organization
* email notification subscriptions for tags and comments
* a barebones search interface
* a user dashboard [presenting recent activity](https://publiclab.org/research)
* a [Question and Answer system](https://publiclab.org/questions)

****
## Installation

1. In the console, download a copy of the source with `git clone https://github.com/publiclab/plots2.git`.
2. Enter the new **plots2** directory with `cd plots2`.
3. Install gems with `bundle install --without production mysql` from the rails root folder, to install the gems you'll need, excluding those needed only in production. You may need to first run `bundle update` if you have older gems in your environment from previous Rails work. 
4. Make a copy of `db/schema.rb.example` and place it at `db/schema.rb`.
5. Make a copy of `config/database.yml.sqlite.example` and place it at `config/database.yml`
6. Run `rake db:setup` to set up the database
7. Install static assets (like external javascript libraries, fonts) with `bower install`
8. (optional) Install solr engine `rails generate sunspot_rails:install`
9. (optional) Start the solr server in foreground by using `bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start`
10. (optional) Index your search database in solr server using  `bundle exec rake sunspot:reindex`
11. Start rails with `passenger start` from the Rails root and open http://localhost:3000 in a web browser.
12. Wheeeee! You're up and running! Log in with test usernames "user", "moderator", or "admin", and password "password".
13. Run `rake test` to confirm that your install is working properly. For some setups, you may see warnings even if test pass; [see this issue](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/440) we're working to resolve.

### Bundle exec

For some, it will be necessary to prepend your gem-related commands with `bundle exec`, for example `bundle exec passenger start`; adding `bundle exec` ensures you're using the version of passenger you just installed with Bundler. `bundle exec rake db:setup`, `bundle exec rake db:seed` are other examples of where this might be necessary.

## Internationalization

Publiclab.org now supports Internationalization and localization, though we are in the initial stages. This has been accomplished with [rails-I8n](https://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n). 

To see it in action, click on the 'Language' dropdown located in the header/footer section of the page. All the guidelines and best practices for I18n can be found [here](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html).

Translations are arranged in the yaml files [here](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/tree/master/config/locales), which are organized in the similar way to [views](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/tree/master/app/views) files. An example for adding translations can be found [here](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html#adding-translations).

To add new languages or for additional support, please write to plots-dev@googlegroups.com
