The content management system for the Public Lab research community, the plots2 web application is a combination of a group research blog of what we call "research notes" and a wiki. 

It features a Bootstrap-based UI and a variety of community and attribution features that help the Public Lab community collaborate on environmental technology design and documentation, as well as community organizing. Originally a Drupal site, it was rewritten in 2012 in Ruby on Rails, and has since extended but not entirely replaced the legacy Drupal data model and database design. 

Some key features include:

* a Markdown-based research note and wiki editor
* [wiki editing](https://publiclab.org/wiki) and revision tracking
* tagging and tag-based content organization
* email notification subscriptions for tags and comments
* a barebones search interface
* a user dashboard [presenting recent activity](https://publiclab.org/research)
* a [Question and Answer system](https://publiclab.org/questions)
