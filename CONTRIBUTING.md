##First Timers

New to open source/free software?, Here are a selection of issues we've made especially for first-timers. We're here to help, so just ask if one looks interesting : https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/projects/2
We also have a slightly larger list of easy-ish but small and self contained issues: https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/labels/help-wanted

When you think you've solved the bug and are ready to submit a pull request, please keep in mind the following:

Make sure these boxes are checked before your pull request is ready to be reviewed and merged.
* [ ] all tests pass -- `rake test:all`
* [ ] code is in uniquely-named feature branch, and has been rebased on top of latest master (especially if you've been asked to make additional changes)
* [ ] pull request is descriptively named with #number reference back to original issue
* [ ] if possible, multiple commits squashed if they're smaller changes
* [ ] reviewed/confirmed/tested by another contributor or maintainer
* [ ] `schema.rb.example` has been updated if any database migrations were added

Make sure you've reviewed our contribution guidelines at https://publiclab.org/wiki/contributing-to-public-lab-software

Also, make sure to reference the issue no as "fixes #<issueno>" in your PRs, so that they can be auto-closed on merging.

We have a loose schedule of reviewing and pulling in changes every Tuesday and Friday, and publishing changes on Fridays. Please alert developers on plots-dev@googlegroups.com when your request is ready or if you need assistance.i

Thank you for your help!
