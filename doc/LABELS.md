# Labels used at Public Lab
At Public Lab, we use many different labels and tags to keep up with issues and pull requests.

We use these labels and tags to mainly help our reviewers/maintainers review our work and also, these labels keep our **plots2** repository organized.

Before contributing to the organization, one should be aware of these and keep them in mind while creating any isues or pull requests.

## Issue labels
For keeping the issues in a systematic way, we use labels which describe the type of issue, the  ` programming language ` used in the issue and so on.
Some of the most used labels are:-
* ` help-wanted ` which indicates the issue requires help by anyone willing to contribute.
* ` bug ` which tells that the issue is regarding one of our programs which faces problems when a certain task is executed.
* ` break-me-up ` says that this certain issue could be and should be broken into smaller self-contained projects for cleaner code separation, more discrete tests, and, easier and iterative collaboration.
* Labels like ` HTML ` , ` CSS ` , ` Ruby ` and ` JavaScript ` tell the **programming language** of the issue.
* ` design ` - This says that the issue requires more design work and discussion (i.e. mockups and sketches).
* ` outreach ` - The outreach issues involve community involvement and helping people who're stuck somewhere.
* Some issues have been labeled with ` fto-candidate ` , ` gci-candidate ` and ` rgsoc ` which mean that these issues have been reserved for students who're participating in these events.

## Pull request labels
For faster review and adoption, we add labels to pull requests too.
Some commonly used PR labels are:-
* ` in-progress ` - This indicates that the pull request is still being worked upon.
* ` needs-help ` - This says that someone is stuck somewhere and needs help to figure that out.
* ` review-me ` - This means seeking for review from Public Lab reviewers.
* ` ready ` - This is used after using the ` review-me ` . This means that the PR is ready for merge.

For pull requests marked with *in progress*, *needs-help*, or *review-me*, here's a checklist of things you can ask for to help a project towards completion:

  * 🎉 encouragement 😄 👍
  * 🔗 links to original issues that they solve with fixes #0000 format in issue body
  * ✍️ more descriptive titles (for quick scanning down a list)
  * 🐞 debugging (if Travis tests did not pass)
  * 👩‍💻 any tips/suggestions on the code itself -- especially simplifying or reducing repetition, increasing readability
  * ✔️ tests to safeguard the new code
  * 📸 screenshots please, if it includes a new design or behavior!
