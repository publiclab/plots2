We use rubocop to lint our code. Help us solve pre-existing linting issues, and also make sure the new code you push is linted properly. To run the linter, run:

```
$ rubocop # Lint the entire codebase

$ rubocop path/to/directory path/to/file.rb # Lint a specific directory or a file

$ rubocop --rails # Include specialized tests for Rails (recommended)
```
