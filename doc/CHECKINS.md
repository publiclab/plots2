# Community Check-ins

One of our community values is openness and diversity in thought. For this reason, we have started weekly check-ins run by our contributors (you!). The check-ins are currently opened as issues in the plots2 repository
 for convenience, but are meant to instigate discussions about any and all repos / topics related to Public Lab. You can always find the most recent check-in pinned at the top of the [issues](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues) page.

New contributors are encouraged to get engaged :).

Below we provide you with information for getting involved and making your own post. These are just guidelines - we encourage you to get creative and lead the check-in with whatever words you would like 💫.

## Rundown 

- First things first: our community aspires to be a respectful place. Please read and abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://publiclab.org/conduct).

- Check-ins are typically opened as issues anytime on Sunday or Monday.

- Volunteer to open the next check-in by leaving a comment on the current one.

-  When you open a check-in please use our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/publiclab/publiclab) chatroom to
notify everyone by referencing `@/all` and linking the post. Include a brief message for new contributors so that they know what it is. ex:

"<em>Hey! Please see our weekly check-in \<here\>. Everyone is welcome to contribute and we encourage new users to get involved</em>."

- Check-ins have a <em>theme</em>. Select any theme that interests you to guide the general flow of responces from the communtiy. 

- Add anything else you'd like. 

  - Discovered a new technology you'd like to share? 

  - Found an interesting article about open source? 

  - Have any questions? 

  - Troubleshot any issues that the rest of the community can learn from?

- Include sections from the [last check-in](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22community+check-in%22) that make sense to carry over. If you need hint for check-in template, theme or content, refer [past check-ins](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22community+check-in%22+).
