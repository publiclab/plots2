# Community Check-ins

One of our community values is openness and diversity in thought. For this reason, we have started weekly check-ins run by our contributors (you!). The check-ins are currently opened as issues in the plots2 repository
 for convenience, but are meant to instigate discussions about any and all repos / topics related to Public Lab. You can always find the most recent check-in pinned at the top of the [issues](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues) page.

New contributors are encouraged to get engaged :).

Below we provide you with information for getting involved and making your own post. These are just guidelines - we encourage you to get creative and lead the check-in with whatever words you would like 💫.

## Rundown 

- First things first: our community aspires to be a respectful place. Please read and abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://publiclab.org/conduct).

- Check-ins are typically opened as issues anytime on Sunday or Monday.

- Volunteer to open the next check-in by leaving a comment on the current one.

-  When you open a check-in please use our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/publiclab/publiclab) chatroom to
notify everyone by referencing `@/all` and linking the post. Include a brief message for new contributors so that they know what it is. ex:

"<em>Hey! Please see our weekly check-in \<here\>. Everyone is welcome to contribute and we encourage new users to get involved</em>."

- Check-ins have a <em>theme</em>. Select any theme that interests you to guide the general flow of responses from the community. 

- Add anything else you'd like. 

  - Discovered a new technology you'd like to share? 

  - Found an interesting article about open source? 

  - Have any questions? 

  - Troubleshot any issues that the rest of the community can learn from?

- Include sections from the [last check-in](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22community+check-in%22) that make sense to carry over. If you need a hint, reference the template, theme, or content of [past check-ins](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22community+check-in%22+).
- [Here](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/9480) is an issue where we list and brainstorm check-in ideas

## Celebrate recent contributors and newcomers!

- Our Welcome Page shows [recent contributors](https://code.publiclab.org#recent-contributors), as well as [recent first-timers-only authors](https://code.publiclab.org/#fto-author) (issues welcoming in newcomers) and list usernames for each, which we can mention and thank or celebrate in the weekly check-in. Use some emoji to show appreciation for those who've been active recently! ✨ 🎉

## Thanks! 

Thank you for helping us maintain our community! 🌐 🎉
