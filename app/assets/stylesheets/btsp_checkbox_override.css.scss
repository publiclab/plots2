/* 
https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/27755 
The issue arises from Bootstrap V4 positioning checkboxes assuming they're a particular 
pixel size, but Windows & Mac (and probably other OS's) size them slighlty differently.

Results in checkboxes not appearing vertically aligned to their labels depending 
on the OS used (incompatibility is system-level) and to varying degrees depending on the browser 
- see here for ex:https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/pull/5372#pullrequestreview-223542883

Note the issue has been flagged to solve for **Bootstrap V5** release.
On update: if resolved, can delete this but ensure compatibility first.
*/

/* 
- To position checkboxes as hanging controls you should **only indent the labels**
this is v.4 usage as well. 
- !important declarations ensure a Bootstrap update wont override these immediately
